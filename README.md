# Anypoint Conversion Examples

This repository contains a set of WSO2 Integration Samples for developers with prior experience in MuleSoft products. To make things easier we have created a set of samples similar to what you see in Mulesoft [Anypoint Integration Examples repository](https://github.com/mulesoft/anypoint-examples). In addition, we have integration samples covering the API management as well as integration use cases.
